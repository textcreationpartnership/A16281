            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For certain of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued the worlde euer to haue been, and that euer it ſhould be, and man together with it to haue had no beginnyng. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine did holde that it had a beginnyng, and an ende it ſhould haue, and a time to haue been, when man was not. For ſaie thei, the begynner of thynges viſible, wrapped vp bothe heauen and earth at one inſtant, togither in one paterne, and ſo a diſtinction growyng on betwixte theſe meynte bodies, the worlde to haue begon in ſuche ordre as we ſee. The aire by nature to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually mouyng, and the moſte firie parie of the ſame, for the lighteneſſe thereof, moſte highe to haue climbed. So that ſonne and Moone, and the planetes all, participatyng of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that lighter ſubſtaunce: moue ſo muche the faſter, in how muche thei are of the more ſubtile parte. But that whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che was mixed with waterie moiſture, to haue reſted in the place, for the heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therof, and of the watery partes, the ſea to haue comen: and the matier more compacte to haue paſſed into a clammi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe firſte, and ſo into earth. This earth then brought by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heate of the ſonne into
<pb facs="tcp:2921:17"/>a more faſteneſſe. And after by the ſame power puffed and ſwollen in the vpper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte parte, there gathered manye hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in ſondry places, which drawing to ripeneſſe encloſed them ſelues in ſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and in filmes, as in the mareſſes of Egipt, and other ſtondynge waters we often ſe happen. And ſeynge the heate of thaier ſokyngly warmeth the cold grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d and heate meint with moiſture is apt to engendre: it came to paſſe by the gentle moiſture of the night aire, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting heate of the daie ſonne, that thoſe humours ſo riped, drawyng vp to the rinde of the arth, as though their tyme of childbirthe ware come, brake out of their filmes, and deliuered vpon the earth all maner of liuyng thinges. Emo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g whiche thoſe that had in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſte heate, became foules into the aire: thoſe that ware of nature more earthie, became wormes and beaſtes of ſondrie kindes: and where water ſurmounted, thei drewe to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemente of their kinde, and had to name fiſſhes. But afterwarde the earth beyng more parched by the heate of the Sonne, and the drouthe of the windes, ceaſed to bring furthe any mo greate beaſtes: and
<pb facs="tcp:2921:17"/>thoſe that ware already brought furthe, (ſaie thei) mainteined, and encreaſed by mutualle engendrure, the varietie, and nombre. And they are of opinion that in the ſame wiſe, men ware engendred in the beginning. And as nature putte them forth emong other beaſtes, ſo liued they at the firſt an vnknowen lyfe wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dely emong them, vpon the fruictes, and the herbes of the fieldes. But the beaſtes aftre a while waxing noyſome vnto them, they ware forced in commune for eche others ſauftie to drawe into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to reſiſte their anoyaunce, one hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping another, and to ſieke places to make their abiding in. And where at the firſte their ſpeache was confuſe, by litle and litle they ſayed it drewe to a diſtincte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and perfeighte difference: in ſorte that they ware able to gyue name to all thinges.

They are thought (as I ſaied) to haue bene the fyrſt of all men, and thoſe whiche of all other maye truelyeſt be called an home-borne people. Neuer vnder the bondage of any: but euer a free nacion. The firſt waie of worſhippyng God (ſay thei) was deuiſed and taught emonge theim: with the maners and ceremonies there to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.

                  <hi>BVT</hi> at this daye as myne Authour <hi>Sabellicus</hi> ſaieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he learned of thoſe that are enhabitantes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrey: The king of Ethiope (whome we commonly calle <hi>Pretoianes</hi> or <hi>Presbiter</hi> Ihon) is a man of ſuche power, that he is reported to haue vndre him thre ſkore and two other kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. If the heade Byſſhoppes of the Realme deſire to do, or to haue aughte done, al is referred vnto him. Of him be giuen al benefites, and ſpiritual promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, which prerogatiue the Pope hath giuen, to the maieſtie of kinges. Yet is
<pb facs="tcp:2921:24"/>he him ſelfe no prieſt, ne hath any maner of ordres. There is of Archebiſſhoppes (that is to ſay of ſuperiour and head biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes) a great nombre, whiche haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one vndre them at the leaſt twenty other. The Princes, Dukes, Earles, and head Biſſhoppes, and ſuche other of like dignitie, when they come abrode, haue a croſſe, &amp; a baſine of golde filled ful of earthe caried before them: that thone maye put them in remembraunce that earth into earth muſt again be reſolued, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other renewe the memory of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes ſuffering. Their prieſtes to haue yſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, mary one wyfe, but ſhe ones beyng dead, it is vnlawfull to mary another.</p>
               <p>The temples &amp; churches ther, are muche larger, much richer, and more gorgeous then ours, for the moſte part voulted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the floore to the toppe. They haue many ordres of deuout men, moche like to our ordres of Religious: as the ordre of S, Anthony, Dominique, Calaguricant, Auguſtines, and Machareanes, whiche are bound to no colour but we are ſome ſuche one as Tharchebyſſhoppe ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe. Next vnto the ſupreame and ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne GOD, and Mary the virgin his
<pb facs="tcp:2921:25"/>mother, they haue moſte in honour Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas ſirnamed Didimus. This King, of all other the worthieſt, whome they call Gias (a name giuen him of his mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power) is of the bloud of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, continued from one generation to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (as they are perſwaded) by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeres of ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And he is not as the moſte of the Ethiopians are, blacke, but white.

By an auncient ordre of the realme, the king liueth euer in preſence and ſighte of his people, and neuer ſoiourneth within the walles aboue two daies. Either for that they iudge it an vncomely thing, and a token of delicate ſlouthfulnes, or elles for that ſome lawe doth forbid it.

               <p>The Aegiptians firſte of all other, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed the names of the twelue Goddes, builte vp Altares, and Images, erected Chappelles, and Temples, and graued in ſtone the ſimilitude of many ſondrie beaſtes. All whiche their doynges, dooe manifeſtly make, that thei came of the Aethiopes, who (as Diodore the Sicilian ſaieth) ware the firſte inuentours of all theſe. Their women in old tyme, had all the trade of occupiyng, and brokage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brode, and reuelled at the Tauerne, and kepte iuſtie chiere: And the men ſatte at home ſpinnyng, and woorkyng of Lace, and ſuche other thynges as women are

Emong the whiche, one is an heade, whoſe ſonne enheriteth his roume by ſucceſſion. The men children, euen of a cuſtome of that people, did with good wil kepe their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, but the women chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren (yf they refuſed it) ware compelled. The moſte part of men in ſolempne bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialles, ſhaue their heades and let theyr beardes growe, but Thegiptians ſhaued their beardes and let their heades grow. They wrought their doughe with their fiete, and their claye with their handes. As the Greciens do beleue, this people, and their ofſpring, are they that vſed cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.

               <p>All the Egiptians offer in ſacrifice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cowe, ne cowe calfe, becauſe they are

They had neither ſlaue that was homeborne, ne ſlaue that was forein bought, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to attende or awaite vpon them. But the ſonnes of thoſe that ware prieſtes of honour, bothe aboue thage of twenty ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, &amp; alſo ſingulerly learned. That the king hauing theſe attendant for the body both by daie and by night, reſtrained by the reuerence of the company about hym might commit nothing that was vicious, or diſhonourable. For men of power are ſeldome euil, where they lacke miniſtres for their vnlawfull luſtes. There ware
<pb facs="tcp:2921:30"/>appoincted houres, bothe of the daie and the night, in the whiche the kinge mighte lawfully doe, what the Lawe did permit. In the morning, aſſone as he was ready, it behoued him to peruſe al lettres, ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacions, and billes: that knowing what was to be done, he might giue aunſwer in tyme: that all thinges might rightlie, and ordrely be done.

Making a proceſſe of theſe, and ſuch other like: in the ende with the reher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalle of the contrary vices, he curſed the wicked &amp; euil. Then abſoluing the King of his offences, he laied all the faulte vpon the miniſtres, and attendauntes, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhouls at any time moue the king to any thing vnright, or vnlawfull. Theſe thinges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge done, he preached vnto the King the bleſſednes of the life, led accordyng to the pleaſure of the goddes, and exhorted him thervnto: as alſo to frame his maners &amp; doinges vnto vertue, &amp; not to giue care to that, that leude me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould counſaile him, but to followe thoſe thynges that led vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to honour and vertue. In thende, whan the King had ſacrificed a bulle, the prieſt declared certain preceptes and examples of exellente, &amp; moſte worthy men: written in their holy ſcripture. To thende that the Kynge admoniſſhed by the example of theim, might ordre his gouernaunte iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and godly, and not geue hym ſelfe to couetous cloinyng, and hourdyng of tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

               <p>The whole realme of Egipte was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aided into Shieres: and to euery Shiere was appoincted a Preſidente, whiche had the gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the whole Shiere.

               <p>Their Iudgementes and Sentences of lawe, are not giuen there at adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture, but vpon reaſon: for thei ſurely thought that all thinges well done, muſte niedes be profitable to mannes life. To puniſhe the offendours, and to helpe the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, thoughte thei the beſt waie to auoide miſchiefes. But to buye of the puniſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente for money or fauour, that thought thei to be the very confuſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune welfare. Wherefore thei chaſe out of the chief cities (as Heliopole, Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phis, and Thebes) the worthieſt men, to be as Lordes chief Iuſtice, or Preſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, ſo that their Iuſtice henche did ſieme to giue place, neither to the Areopagites of the Athenienſes, ne yet to the Senate of the Lacedemonians that many a daie after theim ware in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted. Aftre what tyme theſe chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices ware aſſembled (thirtie in no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bre) thei chaſe out one that was Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the whole: and when he failed, the citie appoincted another in his place. All theſe had their liuynges of the kyng: but the Chauncellour more honorably then
<pb facs="tcp:2921:34"/>the reſt. He bare alwaie about his necke a tablette, hangyng on a chaine of golde, and ſette full of ſundrie precious ſtones, whiche thei called <hi>Veritie</hi> and <hi>Truthe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And a time was giuen to the defendant to write anſwere again to euery poinct, and either to deny that he did it, or elles to alledge that he rightfully did it, or elles to abate the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the damage or wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g. Then had thei another daie appointed, to ſaie final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues.

               <p>And for aſmuche as we are fallen into

               <p>Fyrſt to be periured was headyng: for they thought it a double offence. One in regarde of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce not kept toward god, and another in gyuynge occaſion to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy credite among men, whiche is the chiefeſt bonde of their felowſhip. If any wayfaryng man ſhuld eſpy a man ſette vppon with thieues, or otherwyſe to be wronged, and dyd not to his power ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour &amp; ayde hym, he was gyltie of death. If he ware not able to ſuccour and to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſkewe hym, then was he bounde to vtter the thieues, and to proſecute the matter to enditement. And he that ſo dyd not, was punyſhed with a certayne nombre of ſtripes, and was kept thre days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meate. He that ſhuld accuſe any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrongfully, if he fortuned afterward to be broughte into iudgement, he ſuffered the puniſhement ordeyned for falſe accu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſers. All the Egyptians ware compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to brynge euery man their names to
<pb facs="tcp:2921:35"/>the chiefe Iuſtices, and the facultie or ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence wherby they liued. In the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe if any man lyed, or lyued with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laufull meanes, he felle into penaltie of death. If any man willyngly had ſlaine any man free or bond, the lawes condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned hym to die, not regardynge the ſtate of the man, but the malicious pourpoſe of the diede. Wherby they made men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayd to doe miſchief, and death beynge erecuted for the death of a bondman, the free myght goe in more ſauftie. For the fathers that ſlewe their chyldren, there was no punyſhement of death appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but an iniunction that they ſhoulde ſtande thre daies and thre nyghtes togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the graue of the deade, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a common warde of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſee the thyng done. Neyther dyd it ſieme them iuſte, that he that gaue life to the childe, ſhould loſe his life for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des death, but rather be put to continual ſorowe, and to be pyned with the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the diede, that other myght ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by be withdrawen from the like wycked<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes. But for the chyld that kylled either father or mother, they deuiſed this kynd of ſynguler torment. They thruſte hym
<pb facs="tcp:2921:36"/>and diſfigured.</p>
               <p>The Lawes that apperteigned to the trade and occupieng of men, one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: ware made (as thei ſaie) by one <hi>Bocchorides.</hi> It is commaunded in them, that if money haue bene lent any manne without writyng, vppon credite of his woorde: if the borower deny it, he ſhould be put to his othe, to the whiche the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour muſte ſtande. For thei ſo muche eſtiemed an othe, that thei thoughte no man ſo wicked, as wilfully to abuſe it. And again, becauſe he that was noted to ſweare very ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loſt vtterly his credite, and name: many menne affirme, that for the regard of their honeſties, it happened very ſeldome, that any man came to his othe. Their Lawe maker alſo, iudgyng that vertue was the enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drer of credite, thoughte it good by good ordres to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome men to good liuyng and honeſtie, vpon feare to ſieme vnworthie of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He thought it alſo to be againſt conſcience, that he that without anothe had borowed, ſhould not nowe for his own, bebeleued with anothe. The forfect for non paiment of the lone, mought not bee aboue the double of the ſomme that
<pb facs="tcp:2921:36"/>was borowed. And paiement was made onely of the gooddes of the borower, the body was not arreſtable. For the Lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker thought it conueniente, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gooddes ſhould bee ſubdite to the debte, and the bodies (whoſe ſeruice was required bothe in peace and in warre) ſubiecte to the citie. It was not thoughte to bee Iuſtice, that the manne of warre, whiche haſardeth his bodie for the ſauf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his countrie, ſhould for an entereſt of lone, bee throwen into priſone. The whiche lawe, Solon ſiemeth to haue tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated to the Athenienſes, vndre the name of the lawe, <hi>Siſarea</hi> decreyng that the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of no citezein, ſhould for any maner of entereſt be empriſoned.</p>
               <p>The giptians alſo for thieues, had this lawe alone, and no people els. The lawe commaunded that as many as would ſteale, ſhould entre their names with the chief Prieſte: and what ſo euer was ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, incontinente to cary the ſame vnto hym. Likewiſe, he that was robbed was bounde to entre with the ſaied Chiefe Prieſt, the daie, time and houre, when he was robbed. By this meanes the thefte being eaſely founde out, he that was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb facs="tcp:2921:37"/>loſte the fourthe parte and receiued the reſidue, the whiche fourthe was giuen to the thiefe. For the Lawe maker (ſeing it was impoſſible vtterly to be withoute thieues) thought it moche bettre by this meanes that men bare the loſſe of a piece then to be ſpoiled of the whole.</p>
               <p>The ordre of Mariage emong the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians is not vniforme, for the prieſt might mary but one onely wife. All other haue as many as they wille, acording to their ſubſtaunce. Ther is no child emong them, though it be borne of a bought wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſlaue, that is compted illegitimate. For they onely compte the father to be the authour of his kynde, and the mother onely but to geue place and nouriſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the childe. When their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be borne they bring them vp with ſo lytle coſte, as a man would ſkantly belieue. They fiede them with the rootes of mereruſſhes, and other rootes, roſted in the embries, and with marſhe Caubois, and colewortes which partly they ſeathe, and partly they roſte, and parte giue them rawe. They go for the moſte parte withoute hoſen or ſhoes, all naked, the contry is ſo tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. All the coſte that the Parentes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe
<pb facs="tcp:2921:37"/>on their children til they be of age to ſhift for themſelues, ſurmounteth not the ſomme of a noble.</p>
               <p>The prieſtes bring vp the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both in the doctrine of their holye ſcriptures, and alſo in the other kindes of learning neceſſary for the commune life, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Geometry and Arithmetique. As for the roughe exerciſes of wraſteling, ronning, daunſing, playeng at weapons, throwyng y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> barre or ſuche like, thei train not their youth in, ſuppoſyng that the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe of ſuche, ſhoulde be to roughe, and daungerous for them, and that they ſhould be an empeiryng of ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſique they doe not onely compte vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but alſo hurteful: as making mens courages altogether womanlyke. When they are ſicke, they heale them ſelues, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with faſting or vomiting: &amp; that ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euery eche other daye, or euery third daye, or fourthe. For they are of opinion that all diſeaſes growe of ſuperstuite of meate, and that kinde of cure therfore to be beſte, that riddeth the grounde of the griefe. Men goyng to the warres, or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueillyng the countrie, are healed of free coſt. For the Phiſicens, &amp; Chirurgiens,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:38"/>haue a ſtipende allowed them of ordena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at the charge of the communes.</p>
               <p>In curing, they are bounde to folowe the preceptes of the auncient and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed writers, regeſted in their holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Yf a man folowing the preſcripte of the ſcriptures can not ſo heale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſicke, he is not blamed for that: But yf he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to heale him by any other meanes then is in the ſcripture appoincted, he dieth for it. For the lawe giuer thoughte that it was harde to finde a bettre waye of curing, then that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which of ſuche anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie was by longe practiſe founde cute and allowed, and deliuered vnto them by ſuche a continuaunce. The Egiptians do worſhip aboue meaſure certeine bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes, not onely whileſt they be onliue, but alſo when they are dead. As the Catte, the <hi>Icneumon</hi> the dogge, the hauke, the woulfe, the Cocodrille, and many other like. They are not onely not aſhamed to profeſſe the worſhip of theſe openly, but ſetting them ſelues out in the honouring of them to the vttermoſte: they compte it aſmuch praiſe and glory to them ſelues, as yf they beſtowed the like on the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. And they go about on proceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with
<pb facs="tcp:2921:38"/>the propre Images of them, from citie, to citie, and from place, to place: holding them vp and ſhewing them a farre of vnto other, which fall on their knees, and euery one worſhip them. When any one of them dieth, they couer it with Sarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and houling, and crieng, and beating of their breaſtes they all to beſtrawe the carckeſſe with ſalte. And aftre they haue enbalmed it with the licour of the Cedre and other fragraunt oyntmentes, and oyles, to preſerue it the longer: thei bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye it in holy ſepulture. If a man haue ſlayne any of theſe beaſtes willingly: he is condempned to death. But yf he haue ſlaine a catte or a ſnyte, willingly or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly: the people ronneth vpon him vppon heapes, and withoute all ordre of Iuſtice or lawe, in moſte miſerable wiſe torment him to death. Upon feare of the which daungier who ſoeuer eſpieth one of thoſe lyeng dead: ſtanding a farre, he howleth and crieth profeſſing that he is not giltie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death. Theſe beaſtes with great attendannce and chardge are kept vp aboute the cloiſtres of the Temple, by men of no meane reputation: whiche fiede them with floure and otemeale,

And before thoſe that delight al in raw meate they ſette birdes and rawe foules. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as I ſaid they kiepe them all with great diligence and coſte. They lament their death aſmoche as the death of their owne children, &amp; bury them more ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly then their ſubſtance doth ſtretch. In ſo moche that Ptolomeus Lagus reigning in Egipt, when there chaunced a cowe to die in Memphis, for very age: he that had taken charge of the kepyng of her, beſtowed vpon the buriall of her (beſide a greate ſome of mony that was giuen him for the keping) fiftie talentes of ſiluer, that he borowed of Ptolome.

They haue thre ſortes of Sepulchres, Sumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, meane, and baſſe. In the firſte ſorte they beſtowe a talente of ſiluer. Aboute the ſeconde, twenty Markes, and aboute the thirde litle or nothing. There be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Pheretrers, whoſe facultie it is to ſette forthe burialles, whiche learne it of their fathers and teache it their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Theſe when a funeral happeneth, make vnto him that is doer for the deade, an eſtimate of the exequies in writing, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che the doer may at his pleaſure enlarge or make leſſe. When thei are ones fallen at appoyncte, the bodye is deliuered to the Pheretrer to bee enterred acordyng to the rate that they agreed vpon. Then the bodie beyng laied foorthe, commeth the Pheretrers chiefe cutter, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poincteth his vndrecutter a place on the ſide haulfe of the paunche, wher to make inciſion, and how large. Then he with a ſharpe ſtone (whiche of the country fro whence it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, they call Ethiopicus) openeth the left ſide as farre as the lawe

Thoſe that are the ſeaſoners and embalmers of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (whome they calle poulderers) they haue in greate honour and eſtimacion, for that they haue familiaritie with the prieſtes, and entre the temples together with them.

The body then ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the iudges in the ſight of the people, before it be cofred, if ther be any manne that haue aught to ſaye againſt the dead, he is permitted by the lawe. Yf any be proued to haue liued euyll, the iudges geue ſentence that the bodye ſhall not be buried. And who ſo is founde vniuſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye to haue accuſed, ſuffreth greate pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſhemente therfore. When no manne wyll accuſe, or he that accuſed is knowen

And calling vpon the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre earthe, goddes, they beſeche them to place him emonge the godlye and good. To the which wordes all the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude crieth Amen: ſhowtyng oute, and magnifieng the glorye of the deade, as thoughe they ſhoulde be with the vnder earth goddes, among y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bleſſed for euer.

But the cauſe why thei bent them ſelues ſo muche her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, was for that thei thought ther was no bettre waie poſſible, to driue men to honeſtie of life. The Grekes, which haue ſet furthe ſo many thynges in fained ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and fables of Poetes (farre aboue credite) concernyng the rewarde of the good, and puniſhment of the euill: could not with all their deuices, drawe men ſo vertue, and withdrawe them from vices. But rather co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, haue with them that be leudely diſpoſed: broughte all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in contempte and deriſion. But
<pb facs="tcp:2921:42"/>among the Egiptians, the puniſhemente due vnto the wicked and lewde, and the praiſe of the godlie and good, not heard by tales of a tubbe, but ſene daiely at the eye: putteth both partes in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>braunce what behoueth in this life, &amp; what fame and opinſon thei ſhall leaue of them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, to their poſteritie.

And to make an ende of Thegiptia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, me ſiemeth thoſe Lawes are of very righte to be compted the beſte, whiche regarde not ſo muche to make the people riche, as to aduaunce theim to honeſtie and wiſedome, where riches of neceſſitie muſt folowe.</p>

               <p>Emongeſt all the lawes of that people I note this chiefly as worthie memorie.

But thus muche am I able to ſaie: that in Venice (a citie of famous worthines, and whoſe power is well knowen at this daie, to be greate, bothe by Sea and by lande) ſuche maner as I ſhall ſaie, was ſometyme v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. There was in the Litie of Venice, a place dedicate, as ye would ſaie to our Ladie of Pietie. Before whoſe doores it happened a child or twaine, begotten by a ſkape (whiche either for ſhame or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie could finde no mother, or for the nombre of parteners, no one propre fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to bee laide. And when by the good Litezeins ſuche tendrenes had been ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed to two, or thre, as the mothers loked for, and manhode (to ſaie the truthe) doth require: the dore of pitie became ſo fruict full a mother, that ſhe had not now one or twoo in a yere, but three or fower in a quarter.

<pb facs="tcp:2921:64"/>ſhould fortune ſo to bee offred to Pietie, ſhould bee nouriſſhed at the commune charge of the citie, &amp; none other. And for thoſe acordyngly, thei ordeined a place wher thei ware brought vp, hardly kepte in, and diuerſly enſtructed acordyng to their giftes of witte and capacitie, vntill thei ware mariage able. At the whiche tyme, ſhe that had beautie and good qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities bothe, found thoſe a ſufficient dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to purchaſe her choyſe of huſbandes, And ſhe that hadde but beautie alone, thoughe her qualities ware not ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te, yet for her honeſtie that beſide forth was ſinguler in theim all, founde that beautie and honeſtie could not be vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Theſe therfore ware not permitted to euery mannes choiſe, but graunted to ſuche as ware thoughte menne worthir of ſuche women. If there ware any that lacked the grace of beautie, yet if ſhe ware wittie, and endewed with qualities (together with her honeſtie) a ſmall dow<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rie purchaſed her a huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in good time. But if there ware any in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened neither commendacion of beautie nor wit, but onely bare honeſtie: for her beſtowyng was there a meane found, by

And then did thei mingle it, and kneade it with water into a maner of paaſhe, and ſo baked it, &amp; eate it. There ware thre ſortes of menne that bare rule and office emong them. The king, the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with the Seniours, and thoſe that had ſerueo in the warres and ware now exempte. Thei had alſo menne ſkilfull in the ſecretes of nature, whiche thei calle <hi>Magj,</hi> and <hi>Chaldej,</hi> ſuche as ware the prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes of Egipte, inſtitute to attende vpon the ſeruice of their Goddes. Theſe men all their life daies, liued in the loue of wiſedome, &amp; ware connyng in the cours of the Sterres. And ſometyme by foreto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenyng of birdes Right, and ſomtyme by power of holy verſes and nombres, tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned awaiſe the euilles fro menny, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thinges that ware good. Thei could expounde Dreames, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſignifications of vncouth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dres. So that men ware certein of ſuche ſucceſſe, as thei had foreſhewed. Thei wente not into ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſcholes to learne their knowledge, as the Grecians doe,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:66"/>but learned the ſcience of theſe thynges at their fathers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, as heiritage from one generacion to another, euen from their childhode at home in their houſes. Whereby it came to paſſe that beyng ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly learned, it was bothe the more groundedly learned, and alſo without tediouſnes. Thei had one vniforme and conſtaunt waie of teaching, and one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantnes of doctrine, not waueryng and almoſte contrary to it ſelf, as the doctrine of the Grekes: where eche Philoſopher almoſte had his waie, and iudgemente, of the principles and cauſes of thynges. But theſe menne agre al in one, that the worlde is eternall and euerlaſtyng, with out beginnyng and without ende. And that the ordre of the whole, was diſpoſed by the prouidence of the higheſt. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies aboue to haue their courſe, not at all aduentures and without rule, but by an inuiolable lawe of God, acordyng to his ordenaunce and will moſte certein. Thei haue learned by long markyng and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng of thynges tyme out of mynde, one aftre another: how by the courſe of the Starres, to prognoſtique, that is to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhe we vnto men, many thynges to come

To the ſonne thei attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute brightnes and vertue of life. Mars Iupiter, Mercurie, and Venus, thei ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue moſte (for that thei haue a courſe propre by them ſelues) as interpretours of the mindes of the goddes to foreſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thinges vnto men. Which opinion is ſo grounded in them, that they haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all thoſe foure planetes, by the one name of Mercurius. as ye woulde ſaye commune currours or meſſengers. Thei alſo do warne menne of many thinges, bothe hurtefull and availeable: by the marking, and knowledge of winde and weather, of raine and droughte, of bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſterres, of the eclipſes of the Sonne and Mone, of earthquakes, and manye ſuche like.</p>
               <p>Furthermore thei ymagine in the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament other ſterres, ſubiecte in influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto theſe former. wherof ſome are in the haulfe heauen continually in our ſighte, and ſome in the other haulfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually oute of our ſight.

<pb facs="tcp:2921:67"/>of the whiche they referre one moneth. and one ſigne of the <hi>Zodiaque.</hi> Thei haue prophecied vnto kinges, many aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. As vnto Alexandre victory, when he made his exploicte towarde Dartus.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe to Hirchanour and Seleucus, and other the ſucceſſours of Alexandre, prophecied thei many thinges: As alſo to the Romaines, which had moſt ſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.

And that hervnto thei all agreinge, at wilde aduentures, with oute knowing what thei did, tooke their iorney. In the which thei ware ſore trou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bled, and harde beſtadde, for lacke of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this diſtreſſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ware now ready to lye them downe; &amp; die for thirſt, Moyſes eſpienge a great heard of wilde Chamelles comming fro their fiedinge, and going into woddie place ther beſide, folowed them. And iudginge the place not to be without watre, for that he ſawe it freſſhe and grene, digged and founde plenty of watre. Wherwith when thei

Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes then to the entent he might ſatle the peoples hartes towarde him for euer: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed them newe ordres, and ceremonies cleane contrary to all other nacions. For (ſaieth Cornelius) Looke what ſo euer is holy amonge vs, the ſame is amonge them the contrary. And what ſo euer to vs is vnlawfulle, that ſame is compted lawefull amonge theim. The ymage of the beaſte that ſhewed them the waye to the waters, and the ende of their wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe: did thei ſet vp in their chambres, and offre vnto it a rambe, in the deſpight of Iupiter Hammo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. whom we worſhip in the fourme of a Rambe.

               <p>Swines fleſſhe thei eate none, for that thei holde opinion that this kynde of beaſte, of it ſelfe beinge diſpoſed to be ſkoruie, mighte be occaſion againe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fette them of newe. The ſeuenth daye
<pb facs="tcp:2921:71"/>thei make holy day. That is to ſay ſpende awaie in ydlenes and reſt: for that on the ſeuenth daye, they founde reſte of theyr wandering, and miſery. And when they had caughte a ſauour in this holye daye loytering: it came to paſſe in proceſſe of tyme, that thei made a longe holydaye alſo of the whole ſeuenthyere. But other holde opinion that thei do obſerue ſuche maner of holye daies, in the honour of Saturne the god of faſting and famine: with whoſe whippe thei are lothe againe to be puniſſhed. Their breade is vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned. Theſe ceremonies and deuiſes, by what meanes ſo euer they ware brought in amonge them, thei do ſtiffely defende. As thei are naturally giuen, to be ſtiffe in beliefe, and depe in loue with their owne althoughe towarde al other thei be moſt hatefull enemies.

               <p>But their armies ware altogether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte of ſlaues and bondemen, contrary to the maner of other peoples. And for that no manne hath aucthoritie amonge them to giue fredome vnto anye of this bonde ofſpring: The nombre of them by continuauce, came vnto a greate multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Theſe do thei bringe vp, and make of as deerly, as thei do of their owne chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren: teachinge them to ride, to ſhote, to throwe the darte, and ſuche like feates, with great diligence, and handſomenes.

As for precious ſtones, Beralle Praſnes, Diamantes, firie Carbuncles and Pearles of all ſortes, be found there in greate plentie. Thei haue twoo Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, ſofte pimpelyng windes, a milde aier, a rancke ſoile, and abundaunce of

               <p>All the Yndians generally, weare lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g heare: died either aftre a bright aſſhe cou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lour, or elles an Orenge tawnie. Their chief iuelles, are of Pearle and precious ſtones. Their appareille is verie diuers: and in fewe, one like another. Some go in Mantles of Wollen, ſome of Linnen ſome naked, ſome onely brieched to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the priuities, and ſome wrapped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute with pilles, and lithe barckes of trees. Thei are all by nature blacke of hewe: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo died in their mothers wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>be acordyng to the diſpociſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fathers nature, whoſe ſiede alſo is blacke: as like wiſe in the Aethiopians. Talle men and ſtrongly made. Thei are very ſpare fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, namely when thei are in Campe. Neither delighte thei in muche preaſſe. Thei are as I ſaied, greate deckers and trimmers of them ſelues, haters of theft. Thei liue by lawe, but not written. Thei haue no knowledge of lettres, but admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter altogether without booke. And for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei are voide of guile, and of very ſobre
<pb facs="tcp:2921:84"/>diete: all thing proſpereth well with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thei drinke no wine, but when thei Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifie to their goddes. But their drincke is a bruage that thei make ſometyme of Rize, ſometyme of Barlie. Their meate for the mooſte parte is ſoupynges made alſo of Rize.</p>
               <p>In their lawes, bargaines, and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes, their ſimplicitie and true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng well appeareth: for that thei neuer are muche contencious aboute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Thei haue no Lawes concernyng pledges or thynges committed to another mannes kiepyng. No witneſſynges, no handwri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynges, no ſealynges, ne ſuche like toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of trecherie and vntruſt: but without all theſe, thei truſte and be truſted, thei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue and are belieued, yea, thei oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes leaue their houſes wide open with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out keper. Whiche truely are all greate ſignes of a iuſte and vprighte dealyng e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. But this peraduenture can not ſeatle well with euery mannes fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie: that thei ſhould liue eche manne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte by hymſelf, and euery body to dine and to ſuppe when he luſt, and not all at anhowre determined. For in dede for the felowſhippe and ciuilitie, the contrary is
<pb facs="tcp:2921:84"/>more allowable. Thei comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupie muche as a commune exerciſe, to rubbe their bodies: ſpecially with ſkra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers made for the nones. Aftre whiche, thei ſmothe them ſelues again with <hi>Ebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> wherof I ſpake afore.</p>
               <p>In their Toumbes, and Bewrialles, very plaine and nothyng coſtlie: But in trimming and arraieng of their bodies, to, to, gaude glorious. For there aboute thei neither ſpare gold, ne precious ſtone ne any kinde of ſilke that thei haue. Thei delighte muche in garmentes of white Sarcenet. And for that thei ſette muche by beautie, thei cary aboute with theim phanelles to defende them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſonne, and leaue nothyng vndone, that maketh for the bettre grace of their faces. Thei ſette aſmuche by truthe alone, as by all other vertues together.</p>
               <p>Age hath there no prerogatiue, except thei winne it with their wiſedome, and knowledge. Thei haue many wiues, whithe thei vſe to buye of their parentes for a yoke of Oxen. Some to ſerue them as their vndrelynges, and ſome for plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and iſſue. Whiche maie neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe vſe buttoke banquetyng abrode (for

               <p>No one emong the Yndians either ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifieth coroned, ne offreth odours, ne li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quours. Thei wounde not their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in no maner of wiſe: but ſmore hym by ſtopping the breath. Leaſt thei ſhould offre any mangled thing vnto God, but that that ware in euery parte whole. He that is conuicte of falſe witneſſyng, hath his fingres cutte of by the toppe ioinctes. He that hath taken a limme from any manne, ſuffreth not onely the like loſſe, but loſeth alſo his hande. But if any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue taken from an artificer, his hande, or his eye, it lieth hym vpon his heade.</p>
               <p>The kyng hath a garde of bought wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: who take chardge of his bodie, and haue the trimmyng and orderyng there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the reſidue of the armie, remainyng without the gates. If the Kyng fortune to be droncken, it is not onely lawfull for any one of theſe women to ſlea hym: but ſhe ſhall alſo as in the waie of rewarde, be coupled in mariage to the nexte king. Whiche (as is ſaied) is one of his ſonnes, that afore enioied the Croune. It is not
<pb facs="tcp:2921:85"/>lawful for the king to ſlepe by daie time: and yet in the night tyme to auoide tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, he is forced euery houre to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his chambre. When he is not in campe, he ofte tymes cometh abroade: bothe to giue ſentence, and to heare matiers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendyng in queſtion. And if it be time of daie to trimme his bodie: he bothe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the pleaes, &amp; is rubbed in the meane ſeaſon with the ſkrapers afore mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by thre of his women. He cometh furthe alſo to Sacrifices, and to hunting: Where he is accompaignied with a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of women, in as good ordre as ours ware wonte to be vpon Hocke mondaie. His waie is ranged with ropes, and his garde of menne abideth without. But if it fortune any to ſteale in, to the women (whiche is contrary to their ordre &amp; due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) he loſeth his heade for it. There go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hym Tabours and Belles. When he hunteth in places fenſed aboute, two or thre armed women ſtande preſte, for his aide, and defence. But when he hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in open place, he is caried vppon an Eliphante: &amp; euen ſo ſittyng on his backe ſhooteth, or throweth the darte at his game. Some of his women ride vppon
<pb facs="tcp:2921:86"/>Horſes, ſome vpon Elephantes. As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the warres, where thei fight with all kinde of weapons ſkilfully.</p>
               <p>Suche menne alſo as haue gathered thinges into writynges, recorde: that the Yndians worſhippe as their goddes the father of raine Iupiter: Ganges their floude, and the familiar ſpirites of their countrie.

               <p>The commune wealthe of the Yndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, was ſometyme deuided into ſeuen ſtates or degrees. The Sages (whiche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther calle Philoſophers) ware of the firſt ordre, or ſtate: the whiche although thei ware in nombre feawer then any of the reſt: yet ware thei in honour and dignitie aboute the kyng, farre aboue all other. Theſe menne (priuiledged from all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes) neither be troubled with office, ne be at any mannes commaundemente: But receiue of the communes ſuche thinges as ſerue for the Sacrifices of their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and are requiſite for bewrialles. As though thei ware bothe well acqueinted,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:86"/>and beloued in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and knewe muche of the trade in helle. For this cauſe haue thei bothe giftes and honour largely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And in very diede thei do muche good among the people. For in the begin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yere, aſſemblyng together, thei foreſhewe of raine, of drouthe, of winde and of ſickeneſſe: and of ſuche like thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as maie to profeight be foreknowen For aſwell the kynge as the people, ones vndreſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dyng their foreſawes, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyng the certeintie of their iudgemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes by former experience: ſhone the euil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and are preſte to attende vpon that, that is good. But if any of their ſaid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhall fortune to erre in his foreſight: other puniſhement hath he none, then for euer aftre to holde his peace.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde ordre is of houſebande menne, whiche beyng more in nombre then any of the other ſtates, and exempte fro the warres, and all other labour: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowe their tyme onely in houſebandrie. No enemie ſpoileth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, none troubleth them: but refraineth fro doing them any hurte or hinderaunce, vpon reſpect of the profighte that redoundeth to the whole, throughe their trauailles. So that thei,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:87"/>hauyng libertie without all feare to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe their buſines, are inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and meanes of a bleſſed plenteouſneſſe. Thei with their wiues and children, dwell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie in the countrie, without reſortyng to the tounes or citie. Their paie rente to the Kyng (for all the whole Countrie is ſubiecte to their kyng) neither is it lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any of the commones to occupie and poſſeſſe any grounde, without paie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge rente. And the houſebande men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide this rente, yelde vnto the Kynges maieſtie, a fiueth of their fruictes yerely.</p>
               <p>The thirde ordre ſtandeth all by brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and fieders, of all ſortes, whiche like wiſe neither enhabite toune ne village: but with tentes, in the wilde fieldes. And theſe with huntyng and foulyng in ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie wiſe, ſo kiepe vndre the beaſtes and hurtefull foules: that whear other wiſe the houſebande menne ſhould in fiede tyme, and towarde harueſte, be muche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloyed and hyndered by the fowles, and theim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the fowrthe ordre are Artific ers, and handitraftesmen. Whiche are deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſome into Smithes, ſome into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourers,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:87"/>ſome for one purpoſe, ſome for another, as is expediente. Theſe doe not onely liue rence free, but alſo haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of graine allowed them at the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges allowaunce.</p>
               <p>In the fiueth ordre are the menne of warre, a greate uombre daiely exerciſed in armes, bothe on Horſebacke, on Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes, and on foote. And all their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes, and horſes miete for their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, are found of the kinges allowaunce.</p>
               <p>The ſixteth ordre is of Surueiours or Maiſters of reporte, whiche haue the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſighte of all thynges that are done in the realme, and the charge to bryng rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte vnto the kyng.</p>
               <p>In the ſeuenth place, are thei that be Preſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and heades of the commune cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſailles, very fewe in nombre, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their nobilitie and wiſedome. Out of theſe are choſen counſailours for the kynges Courtes, and officers to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrethe commune wealth, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouerſies: yea, capitaines for the warres, and Princes of the realme.</p>
               <p>The whole ſtate of Ynde beyng deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into theſe ordres or degrees: it is alſo ordeined, that a man ſhall not marie out
<pb facs="tcp:2921:88"/>of the ordre, wherin his callyng lieth, ne chaunge his trade. For neither maie the ſouldiour occupie houſebandrie thought he woulde: ne the artificers entremedle with the doctrine of the Sages.</p>
               <p>There are alſo amonge the Yndians, perſons of honour appointed to be as it ware Tutours of ſtraungiers, to ſee that no wronge be done them, to put or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre for their kepyng, and Phiſicke, if any falle ſicke. As alſo (if it fortune any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to die) for the bewrieng of theim, and to deliuer their goodes, and money to their nexte friendes.</p>
               <p>All cauſes are broughte afore the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who heare the parties, and punyſſhe the offenders diligently. Ther is no ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery amonge them. Yea, thei haue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ordinaunce, that none ſhalbe ſlaue or bonde amonge them, but all fre, and of equalle aucthoritie and honour. For thei holde opinion that who ſo accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his ſelfe neither to be Lorde ouer other, ne to wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge any bodie: y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man hath prepared him ſelfe ſauftie and eaſe what ſo euer ſhall happen hym by any aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And a fonde thing ware it to make the lawes indifferente for all, and not to
<pb facs="tcp:2921:88"/>make the ſtates of the men indifferente</p>
               <p>But becauſe ther are in Indemanye ſondrie contries, diuerſe bothe in people and tongue (as in ſo large a thing muſte nedes happen) ye ſhall vnderſtonde that thei do not all alike vſe ſuche trade as I haue deſcribed, but in ſome plares ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what worſe.</p>
               <p>Of thoſe that lie towarde the Eaſte, ſome occupie brieding, and ſome do not. Other dwellinge in the merſhe, and fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vpon the riuers ſide: occupie fiſſhing, and liue by the ſame all rawe. And the bettre to worcke their feate, thei make them ſelues boates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuche canes as growe ther, of a wonderfull biggenes.</p>
               <p>So, that ſo muche of the cane as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixte ioyncte and ioyncte, is a iuſte pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porcion of timbre for one of their boates.</p>

               <p>Thoſe that be yet by Eaſte of them, are
<pb facs="tcp:2921:89"/>brieders of cataille: and liue altogether with rawe fleſhe, and haue to name Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. Whoſe condicions are ſayde to be ſuche.</p>
               <p>As often as it fortuneth any of their citezeins to be ſicke, yf it be manne: his niereſt friendes, and thoſe that are moſte aboute him, kylle him by and by. leaſte (ſaye thei) his fleſhe ſhould waxe worſe. Yea, thoughe he woulde diſſemble the matier, and denie him ſelf to be ſicke, it boteth not. For withoute pardon, they kille him, and make a feaſte with him. If it be a woman, looke how the menne did by the manne, ſo do the women by a woman. Like wiſe do thei with bothe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, when thei waxe croked for age, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impotente: where throughe, what by the one meanes and the other, none of them die for age.</p>
               <p>Ther is another ſorte of the Indians that kille no liuinge thing, ne plante nor ſowe, nor builde houſe: but liue with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes, and a certeine ſede whiche groweth there of the owne accorde, muche like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gromelle. whiche thei gather with the cuppe or ſhelle that it groweth in, and ſo ſeeth it, and eate it. If any of theſe falle
<pb facs="tcp:2921:89"/>ſicke, he wandereth forthe into ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte place, and ther laieth him downe: no manne taking hede either to his lieng or to his dienge.</p>
               <p>All theſe Yndians that I nowe haue ſpoken of, in quenching of natures heate, vſe their women as ſecretly as beaſtes do their females.</p>
               <p>Theſe Yndians haue a kinde of ſages, that the Griekes calle. <hi>Gimnoſophiſtae,</hi> whiche as the worde <hi>Sophiſta</hi> ſoundeth now, might merily be interpreted brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheleſſe bablers.

Theſe (as <hi>Petrarche</hi> writeth) haunte the outemoſte borders, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowie partes of that countrie, wadering naked acordinge to their name, vp and downe, heather and theather, ſtudienge, and ſearching the natures of thinges, the courſe of the heauens, and the ſecretes of knowledge.

               <p>Amonge theſe, is ther a people called <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> whiche (as Didimus their king wrate vnto Alerandre when he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t aboute to ſubdue them) liue a pure and ſimple life, led with no likerous luſtes of other mennes vanities.

<pb facs="tcp:2921:90"/>helpe and reliefe, wher no manne maketh clayme by <hi>(thine)</hi> and by <hi>(myne)</hi> but euery manne taketh what he luſteth and luſteth no more then he niedeth. Enuie cannot dwell ther, ne none of her impes, wher all be equalle, and none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue other. and all alike poore, maketh all alike riche. Thei hane no officers of Iuſtice among them, becauſe thei do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ought to be puniſſhed. Ther ran no lawe appiere, becauſe none offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce appeareth.</p>
               <p>The whole people hath one onely lawe, to do nothinge againſt lawe that nature preſcribeth. To cheriſhe labour, to barre out ydlenes, and baniſhe colle couetyſe. That lechery licke not away the vigour of their ſpirites, and ſtrength: nor lacke throwe menne into deſperate doompes. That euery manne hath enoughe, wher no manne couettes more. That neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For whome ſhe catcheth, ſhe throweth a foote beneth beggery, whileſt thei canne finde none ende of their ſcrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge, but the more thei haue, the fellier gnaweth their longing.</p>
               <p>Thei warme by the Sonne, the deawe

Lare brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not their ſleape, Compaſſing of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities wearieth not their minde. Pride hath no ſtroke ouer them, among whom ther is no diuerſite. Neither is their any kinde of bonde knowen amonge them: but the bondage of the body to the minde whiche thei onely allowe to be iuſte.</p>
               <p>For the building of their houſes, they ſende not ouer ſea for ſtone, thei burne no Calion to make lime to tempre their mortre, thei bake no brickes, nor diggs no ſande. But either make them caues in the earthe, or take ſuche as thei finde rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made in the ſides of the mounteines and hilles. Ther dwel thei with out feare of rage or ruine, of weather or of winde. He thineketh him ſelf ſanflter fenced fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhowres with his caue, then with a fewe tiles: and yet hath by it a double commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie. A houſe while he liueth, &amp; a graue ready made when he dyeth. Ther is no glittering apparell, no rattelinge in ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, no ruſteling in veluettes, but a litie brieche of brawded ruſſhes, or rather a couering of honeſte ſhamefacedneſſe.</p>
               <p>The women are not ſette oute to aliure,

For why they eſtieme in theſe, neither the honour of the quicke, ne the pleaſure of the deade: but raither the trouble and paine of bothe. Peſtilence or other diſeaſes (as I haue ſayd) the Abrahmanes are not annoyed with, for thei enfecte not the ayer with any filthye doinges. But nature alwaye with them, keapeth accorde with the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: and euery elemente his tourne, with
<pb facs="tcp:2921:92"/>oute ſtoppe or barre. Their Phiſicque is abſtinence, which is able not only to cure the maladie already crepte in: but alſo to holde oute ſuche as otherwiſe mighte en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. Thei couette no ſightes, nor ſhewes of miſrule: no diſguiſinges nor entrelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. But when thei be diſpoſed to haue the pleaſure of the ſtage, thei entre into the regeſtre of their ſtories, &amp; what thei finde there moſte fit to be laughed at, that do thei lamence &amp; bewaile. Thei delighte not as many do, to heare olde wiues ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and fantaſies of Robin hoode: but in ſtudious conſideracion of the wondreful workemanſhip of the world, &amp; the perfect diſpoſinge of thinges in ſuche ordre of courſe and degree. Thei croſſe no ſeaſe for merchaundiſe, ne learne no colours of Rethoricque. Thei haue one kinde of plaine eloquence commune to them all: tongue, &amp; harte agreinge in truthe. Thei haue neither moote halles, ne vniuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whoſe diſagreable doctrine more leaning to apiſſhe arte, then natural rea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon and experience, neuer bringeth anye ſtaye, or certeintie of thinges.

Thei thincke it no honour to God, to ſlea for him an innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te beaſt: yea thei ſay he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth not the ſacrifice of men polluted with bloode<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but rather loueth a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip voide of all bloodſheade. That is to ſaye the humble entreatie of woorde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that proprety only (to be entreated with woordes) is commune to God and to manne. With this therefore ſaye they he is pleaſed, becauſe we ſomewhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him ſelf therin. And this was the life of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnchriſtened Brahmanes, wher with we chriſtianes are ſo farre out of loue, that we are afraied leaſte any man ſhould beleue it to be true.</p>
               <p>The Yndians called Catheis, haue eche man many wiues. And aſſone as anyone huſbande fortuneth to die, his whole no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So gladde is ſhe to haue the victorie in the contencion of wiuely chaſtitie, and honeſte behautour toward her huſbande. And the other that lyue, thincke them ſelues diſhonoured: and eſcape not without ſpotte of reproche as longe as thei liue.

But if it fortune thoſe to ſmelle any hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſtincke, it is as preſent deathe vnto theim, as poyſon to vs. It is recorded in writyng, that certaine of thoſe ware in Alexandres campe.</p>
               <p>We rede alſo that there are in Inde me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with one eye and no mo. And certein ſo notably eared that thei hange downe to their hieles, with ſuche a largeneſſe that thei may lye in either of them as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pallet: and ſo harde, that thei maye rende vp trees with them. Some other alſo hauing but one legge, but vpon the ſame ſuch a foote, that when the ſonne is hote, and he lacketh ſhadowe, lyenge downe vpon his backe, and holdinge vp his fote, he largely ſhadoweth his whole bodie.</p>
               <p>It is redde that in Cleſia certein wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men haue but ones childe in all their life time: and the children aſſone as thei are borne, immediatly to become horeheded. Againe, that there is another nacion, much lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger liued then we are, whiche in their youth are horeheared: and in their age, their heare waxeth blacke. They
<pb facs="tcp:2921:94"/>affirme alſo that ther is another ſorte of women that conceiue at fyue yeres olde, and liue not aboue the age of. viii. yeres. Ther are alſo that lacke neckes, &amp; haue their eyes in their ſhoulders. Ther are alſo beſide theſe, certeine ſaluages with dogges heades, &amp; ſhacke heared on their bodies, that make a very terrible char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe with their mouthes.</p>
               <p>But in theſe and ſuche like tales of the Indians, and their countrie: for that a manne had nede of a redie beliefe that ſhould take theim for truthes, one had not niede to bee to large: conſiderynge ſpecially that menne nowe a daies, will ſkante beleue the reporte of other mens writinges, in the thinges that almoſt lye vndre their noſes.</p>
               <p>Ther is a place betwixt Gedroſia and the floude Yndus which is called <hi>Cathai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> of the <hi>Cathaiens</hi> that enhabyte it.</p>
               <p>This people ware an offpring of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, muche altered from their naturall condicions, and wonted maners, if that that Altone the Arminiane writeth of them in his ſtorie, be true.</p>
               <p>Thei paſſe (ſaieth he) all other men in quicke ſmelling. And thei ſaye of them
<pb facs="tcp:2921:95"/>ſelues, that though all other menne haue two inſtrumentes of ſight, yet do none ſe with both two in dede, but thei: all other men in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſon either to haue no ſight, or elles as it ware but with one eye.</p>
               <p>Their wittineſſe is greate, but their boa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtinge greater. The whole nacion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is perſwaded, that thei muche paſſe all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men in knowledge, and the ſubtilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of ſciences. Thei are all of colour ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning white, ſmalle eyed, beardeleſſe by nature. Their lettres are aftre the facio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romaine, all in ſquares. Thei are diuerſelyledde with fonde ſuperſticions, ſome aftre one ſorte, and ſome aftre ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But thei are all voyde of the true knowledge which is in Ieſus Chriſte. Some worſhip the ſonne, ſome y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moone. Other, ymages of yoten metalle, manie of them an ore. And thus to ſondry ſuche other monſters, hath this people in ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry wyſe deuided it ſelfe in ſuperſticion. Thei haue no maner of written lawes, nor knowe not what we meane whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeake of faithfulneſſe or truſtineſſe. And wher (as I ſaid afore) thei haue in al ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di worckes a paſſing ſubtiltie of witte, yet in the knowledge of heauenly thinges,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:95"/>thei are altogether to learne: that is to ſaie, thei are vtterly ignorau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. A coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people and very feareful of death. Yet exerciſe thei a maner of warre, but that thei handle rather by witte, and pollicie, then by ſtrength and hardineſſe. In their fighte thei vſe a kinde of ſhaftes, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other weapons of flight, vnknowen to other countries.</p>
               <p>Their money is a piece of ſquare pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with their Kynges Image vpon it. And becauſe it cannot be durable: ordre is taken, that when it is ſoiled or duſked muche, with paſſyng from man to man, thei ſhall bring it to the coignyng houſe, and make exchaunge for newe. All their vtenſiles and neceſſaries of houſe, are of golde, ſiluer, and other metalles. Oile is ſo deintie emong theim, that the kyng onely vſeth it, as it ware for a precious ointement. Thus haue we treated of the Yndians, and now to their borderers, the Scithians.</p>

Or as <hi>Beroſus</hi> Iudgeth, of an other Scitha, borne ofoure greate graundame Araxe, Noahes wife, that dwelt firſt in that countrie. This people in the beginnyng, pente within narowe boundes, ſo in proceſſe by litle and litle, through their valeauntnes and force en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged their limites: that thei became lor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des of many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries aboute, and grewe into a great gouernaunce and renoume. Thei neſtled firſt vpon the floude Araxis ſo fewe in nombre and ſo baſe: that no manne thought theim worthie the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blyng or talkyng of. But gettyng vnto them a certein king, hardie, of great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and notable experience in the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res: thei enlarged their land ſo, that thei made it ſtretche on the one parte (whiche is altogether Hille, and Mounteigne) vnto Caucaſus, and ouer al the plain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Occean, &amp; vnto the greate marſhe of Meotis, and Tanais the floude. From
<pb facs="tcp:2921:96"/>whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the countrie of Scithia now ſtret<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cheth all along toward the Eaſt. And be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe the mounteigne Imaus, ronnyng along as the countrie coaſteth, deuides it in the middes into two haulues: the one haulfe is called Scithia within Imaus, and the other without (as ye would ſaie) on this ſide the Mounte, and beyonde. There neuer medled any power with theim, that was able to conquere theim: or muche to endamage theim. Thei for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Darius, the Kyng of the Perſians, with greate diſhonour to flie their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Theiſſue Cirus with all his armie. Thei made an ende of Alexandre with al his power. The Romaines ſente theim threates thei would warre with theim, but thei proued in fine but wordes. Thei are a people not tameable with any toile bittre warriours, and of greate ſtrength of bodie. At the firſt very rawe, and with out any ordinarie trade of life: neither knowyng what tillage meant, ne yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng any houſes or cotages to dwell in. But wandryng vp and boune the wilde fieldes and driuyng their catteille afore theim, their wiues and their children ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng in wagons by them. Thei obſerned
<pb facs="tcp:2921:97"/>iuſtice, without conſtraint of lawe. Thei compted none offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce more heinous, then thefce. As folke that had nothyng vndre locke nor keye, barre, nor bolte: but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the open fielde. Thei nether oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied golde ne ſiluer. Their chief foode was milke and Hony. Againſt colde and other ſtormes, thei wrapped their bodies in felles, and hides of beaſtes, and Mice ſkinnes. Thei knewe not what Wollen meante, ne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any facion of garmente.</p>
               <p>This maner of life was in many of the Scithians, but not in all. A greate nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre of theim, as thei muche differed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce of place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> other, ſo differed thei alſo from other in maners: and vſed a certeine trade of liuyng emong them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, wherof we aftreward will entreate, when we haue ſaied ſomewhat more of their facions in generall.</p>
               <p>Many of the Scithians delight in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlaughter. And the firſte man that he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in fight, his bloud drincketh he: and offreth vnto his Kynge the heades of all thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ther ſleaeth. For when he hath ſo done, he is admitted to be partaker of the butine what ſo euer it be, whereof he ſhould be otherwiſe partles. He cutteth
<pb facs="tcp:2921:97"/>of the heade aftre this ſorte. Firſte, with his knife he maketh in it a gaſhe rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute like a circle, vndre the eares: then taketh he it by the heare of the croune, &amp; ſtriketh it of. That done, he fleaeth it, and taweth the ſkinne betwixte his han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, vntill it become very ſouple and ſoft and kiepeth it for a hande kercher. This wille he hange vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reine of his horſe, and glorieth not a litle in it. And he that hath moſte of ſuche ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dkerchers, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted the valeaunteſt manne. There are many alſo that ſowe together theſe ſkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of menne, as other doe the ſkinnes of beaſtes, and weare theim for their clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng. Some of them flea the right hand of their enemies beyng ſlaine, ſo that the nailes alſo remain vpon the fingres, and make couers of theim for their quiuers.</p>
               <p>Many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> flea the whole bodie, and ſtretche out the ſkinne vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> certaine ſtic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes fitted for the nones, and ſo ſprede the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon their Horſe. Of the Skulles of the heades thus ſlaine, thei make maſures to drincke in: coueryng them on the outſide with rawe Neates leather, and gilding them on the inſide, if he be of habilitie. And when any gheſte of eſtimacion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

And thei dwell vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the floude Boriſthenes, about the place wher it becometh firſt ſaileable. This people when thei haue receiued it, trenche out a ſquare plotte in the ground very wide and large. And then rippe the healy of the corps, and bowelle it cleane: clenſyng it and drieng it from all filthe, and fille it vp with <hi>Siler Montanum,</hi> Franckencenſe, Smallache ſiede, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe ſiede, beaten together in a Mortre. And when thei haue ſowed it vp againe cloſe, thei ceare the whole bodie, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighe the ſame in a Carte, to the nexte people vndre the gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whiche with honour receiue it, and conueigh it vnto the nexte of their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: and ſo from one to another, vntle it haue paſſed rounde aboute, to as many peoples, as are of their dominion, and be comen againe to the place of bewriall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gerrites. whether it is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painied with a certain of all the peoples,

Whiche thei al firſt ſtrangle, and thruſte in, together with a porcion of all ſortes of plate, and of euery ſuche thyng as apperteined to his houſholde, or body. And when the yere comes about, then do thei thus.

Thei dwelle as it ware in the beginnyng, or entryng of the worlde. And for that thei liue aftre a chaſt ſort: thei are neither ſkourged with Blaſtynges, ne Haile, ne Peſtilence, ne ſuche other euilles. No manne toucheth a woman there, aftre ſhe hath conceiued, ne yet in the tyme of her flowres. Thei eate none vncleane beaſtes, ne knowe what Sacrifiſyng meaneth.

               <p>The thirde people ware called Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chates, and the fourthe Metrites. There was no difference betwixte them eyther in body or la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>guage, but al aftre one ſorte and facion. Their behauour was in the beginning very brute, and farre oute of ordre, without lawe or diſcipline, or any good facion. Thei liued amonge the Scithians, and kept herdes of cattalle in very baſe ſtate and condition: and ware tributaries to all their neighbours.</p>
               <p>But within a while aftre, thei deuided them ſelues as it ware into wardes, to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of the which was appointed a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: in whoſe deuiſes and conſentes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The multitude that ſerued for their war<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>res, was thus deſtributed.

               <p>This done, to proue the obedience of his ſubiectes, he commaunded ſeuen ſonnes of the Princes or Dukes whiche before had gouerned the people: to be ſlaine by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des of their owne fathers, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <p>The Tartares are very deformed, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of bodie for the moſte parte, hauyng great ſtiepe eyes: and yet ſo heary on the eye liddes, that there ſheweth but litle in open ſight. Platter faced and beardleſſe, ſauyng vpon the vpper lippe, and a litle about the poincte of the chinne thei haue a feawe heares as it ware priched in with Bodkins. Thei be communely all, ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre in the waſte. Thei ſhaue the hindre

On the other parte, thei ſuffre their heare to growe at lengthe like our women: whiche thei deuide into two treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, or braudes, and bryng aboute to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten behinde their eares. And this maner of ſhauyng, do thei vſe alſo that dwelle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theim, of what nacion ſo euer thei be. Thei theim ſelues are very light and nimble: good on Horſe, but naughte on foote. All from the moſte to the leaſte, as well the women as the menne: doe ride either vpon Geldynges, or Rien, where ſo euer thei become. For ſtoned Horſes thei occupie none, ne yet Gelding that is a ſtriker, and lighte of his heles. Their bridelles are trimmed with muche gold, ſiluer, and precious ſtones. And it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted a ioly thyng emong theim: to haue a great ſort of ſiluer ſounded belles, gyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyng aboute their horſe neckes. Their ſpeache is very chourliſhe and loude.</p>
               <p>Their ſingyng is like the bawlynge of Woulues. When thei drincke, thei ſhake

Their dwellyng is neither in tounes ne Bouroughes. But in the fiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des abrode, aftre the maner of thauncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Scithians in tentes.

In the wintre time thei are wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to drawe to the plaines, &amp; in the Somer ſeaſon, to the mounteignes &amp; hillie places for the better paſture.

In the middes of the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, is their fire, aboute the whiche their wife and their children doe ſitte. The menne delight muche in dartyng, ſhootyng, and wraſtelyng. Thei are merueilous good hunters, to the whiche thei go armed at all pieces. And aſſone as thei eſpie the beaſte, thei come coſting together rounde aboute and encloſe her.

               <p>Thei belieue that there is one GOD that made all thynges, bodily &amp; ghoſtly, ſene or vnſene, and hym thei honour: but not with any maner of Sacrifice or cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie.

To theſe thei offre the firſt milke of all their milche catteill, of what kinde ſo euer thei be. And before thei begin either to eate or drinke aught, thei fette a porcion thereof before theim. Looke what beaſte thei kille to be eaten, thei reſerue the harte all nighte in ſome couered cuppe, and the nexte mornynge ſeath it and eate it.</p>

Thei marke many ſeaſons, and ſpecially haue regarde to the chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Moone.

               <p>This is a notable meruaile, that though amonge theim manye women haue but one manne: yet thei neuer lightely falle out, ne brawle one with another for him. And yet are the menne parcialle in theyr loue: ſhewing muche more fauour to one then another, and goynge fro the bedde of the one, ſtreighte to the bedde of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>Thoſe that are not occupied for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, driue the catteile a fielde, and there kepe them.

To this the people yealde with greate ſhoutes, and reioiſynges. In the meane while the princes and the nobles, taking the king our of his throne, ſpread abrode on the grounde a piece of felte: v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the whiche, thei cauſe hym in ſimple ſorte to ſitte doune, and thus ſaie to hym.

And liftyng vp the felte alofte, haile hym by the name of Emperour, &amp; her by the name of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe.

Of the whiche he giueth giftes to al

               <p>In his hande and power is then alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no manne can: or though he can, he dare not ſaie this is myne, or this is his. No man maie dwelle in any parte of the lande, but in that wherevnto he is appoincted.

He hath fiue armies of greate multitude and force: and fiue chiefteines, by whom he ſubdueth all that ſtande a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt hym.

For it is not lawefull for any manne, to chaunge the kynges woordes: ne for any man in any wiſe, to replie againſt ſuche ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as he giueth. He neuer drincketh in open preſence, but ſome body firſt ſing to hym, or plaie vpon ſome inſtrumente of Muſicque.</p>
               <p>The gentlemen and menne of honour when thei ride, haue a phannell borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, on a Iauelines ende, to kiepe awaie the Sonne. And as it is ſaied, the wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> likewiſe. Theſe ware the maners and facions of the Tartarres, for a two hundred yeres paſte.</p>
               <p>The Georgia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whom the Tartarres aboute the ſame tyme did ſubdue: ware chriſtians, aftre the fourme of the Greke Churche. Thei ware neighbours to the Perſians. Their dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſtretched out a great length, from <hi>Paleſtine</hi> in Iewrie to the mounteignes called Caſpij. Thei had eightene Biſhopries: and one Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicque: that is to ſaie, one generall bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe, whiche was to them, as our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane
<pb facs="tcp:2921:116"/>to vs. At the firſte thei ware ſubiecte to the Patriarche of Antioche<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Menne of greate courage and hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Thei all ſhaued their crounes: the Laietie ſquare, the Clercques rounde. Their women (certeine of theim) had the ordre of Knighthode, and ware trained to the warres. The Georgianes when thei ware ſette, ordered, and raunged in the fielde, and ware at poinct to ioyne the batteill: vſed to drincke of a gourdfull of ſtrong wine, aboute the bigguenes of a mannes fiſte. And to ſette vpon their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: muche amended in courage.</p>
               <p>Their Clercques, whiche we calle the Spiritualtie, mighte vſe bothe Simonie and vſurie at their wille. There was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall hatred betwixte Tharmenians and them. For the Armenians ware alſo chriſtians, before the Tartarres had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the Georgianes and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But thei differed in many thinges, from the belief and facions of the true Churche. Thei knewe no Chriſtemas daie, no vigilles, nor the fowre quartre faſtes, whiche we call Embryng daies. Thei faſted not on Eaſter eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe (ſaie thei) that Chriſt roſe that daie aboute euen tide. Vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="tcp:2921:117"/>Saturdaie, betwixte Eaſter and Whitſontide, thei did eate fleſſhe. Thei ware greate faſters, and beganne their Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te thre wekes afore vs: and ſo ſtreigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly faſted it, that vpon the Wedenſdaie and Fridaie, thei neither eate any kinde of fiſſhe, ne aughte wherin was wine, or oile. Belieuing that he that drancke wine on theſe twoo daies: ſynned more then if he had bene at the ſtewes with a whore. On the Monedaie thei abſteined from all maner of meate. On Tewſdaie and Thurſdaie, thei did eate but one meale. Wedenſdaie and Fridaie, nothyng at al. Saturdaie and Sondaie, thei eate fleſhe and made luſtie chiere. Throughe their whole Lente, no manne ſaid Maſſe but on Saturdaies and Sondaies. Nor yet on the Fridaies throughout the whole yere: for thei thought then, that thei brake their faſt. Thei admitted to the houſeale, aſwell children of two monethes olde, as all other indifferently. When thei went to Maſſe, thei vſed to put no watre in the wine. Thei abſteined from Hares fleſhe Beaws fleſhe, Crowes, and ſuche other as the Grekes did, and Iewes do. Their Chalices ware of Glaſſe, and of Tree.
<pb facs="tcp:2921:117"/>Some ſaid Maſſe without either albe or veſtement, or any maner ſuche orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Some onely with thorname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con or Subdeacon. Thei ware all buſie vſurers, and Simonites: bothe ſpirituall and Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall, as the Georgianes ware. Their prieſtes ſtudied Sotheſaieng and Nigromancie. Their Spiritualtie vſed Iunckettyng oftener then the Laietie.</p>
               <p>Thei maried, but aftre the death of the wife, it was not lawefull for the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande to marie againe, nor for the wife, aftre the death of the houſebande. If the wife ware a whore, the Biſſhoppe gaue hym leaue to put her awaie, and marie another. As for the fire of Purgatorie thei knewe nothing of it. Thei denied al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo verie ſtifly, that there ware two natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res in Chriſte. The Georgianes ſaied that thei ſwarued from the truthe of Chriſtes Religion, in thirtie poinctes or articles.</p>

               <p>He ſaid the Iewes did wickedly to denie Chriſte to be borne of the virgine Mary, ſeinge the prophetes (me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of great holineſſe, &amp; enſpired with the holy ghoſt) had foreſhewed the ſame, &amp; warned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of many yeres paſſed to looke for him.

                  <hi>Martinus Segonius nouomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tanus,</hi> in his booke of the Sepulchre of Chriſte our king, writeth that the Turkes, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racenes by an auncient opinion receiued from Machomet: do laughe Chriſtian menne to ſkorne, that ſeke thether with ſo greate reuerence. Sayeng that Chriſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet of all prophetes endewed with the ſpirite of God, and voyde of all earth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly corruption: had ther no ſepulchre in ve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry diede, for that he being a ſpirituall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued by the breathe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy ghoſt coulde not ſuffre, but ſhould come againe to be iudge of the Gentiles.

When this countrefeicte prophet had ſauſed his ſecte with theſe wicked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions: he gaue them his lawe, and ſorte of religion. Againſt the whiche leſſe any man of righte iudgemente ſhould aftre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde write or diſpute (as againſt a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent and filthie perſwaſion) he wrote a lawe in his Alcorane that it ſhoulde be deathe to as many as ſhould reaſon or
<pb facs="tcp:2921:119"/>diſpute vppon it. Wherby he euidentlie declared, that ther was nothing godly or goodly therin. For why ſhould he elles haue ſo raked it vp in the aſſhes, and for bidden it to be examined: ſo that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple coulde neuer come to knowledge what maner of thinge it is that thei be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue in. In the giuing of his lawe, he vſed muche the counſelle &amp; helpe of the mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che Sergius: of the wicked ſecte of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorianes. And to the ende it might pleaſe the more vniuerſally: he patched it vp to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with peces of all maner of ſectes. He thoughte it good to ſette out Chriſte with the beſte, affirminge that he was a manne excelling in all holineſſe and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rue. yea he extolled him to a more heigth then was appliable to the nature of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, calling him the woorde, the ſpirite, the ſoule of GOD, borne out of a virgines wombe, whome he alſo with many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drefull praiſes magnified. He confirmed with his conſente, the miracles, and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the goſpel, as farre as it varieth not from his Alcorane.</p>
               <p>The Godſpelles ſaid he ware corrupte by the diſciples of the Apoſtles. And ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore it behoued his Alcorane to be made,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:120"/>for to correcte and amende them. Thus fauning into fauour with the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, he would haue bene chriſtened of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius. Then to procure, &amp; moue other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to fauouor his procedinges: he denied with the Sabellians the Trinitie. With y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Manicheis he made two goddes. with Eunomius, he denied that the father and the ſonne ware equal. With Macedoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us he ſaid that the holy ghoſte was a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature, or ſubſtaunce created. With the Nicholaites he allowed the hauinge of many wiues at ones. He allowed alſo the olde teſtament. Althoughe ſayd he, it ware in certain places faultie. And theſe fondeneſſes did he beſwiete with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drefull lure of the thinges that menne in this lyfe mooſte deſire. Lettinge louſe to as many as helde of him, the bridle of al lechery and luſte. And for that cauſe doth this contagious euil ſprede it ſelf ſo wide into innumerable contries.

And therfore at what time they ware hired of Heraclius in the warres againſte the perſians: when he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victory, and thei perceiued them ſelues to be defrauded by him: kindled with the angre of the villanye thei had had done vnto them, by the counſell and perſwaſion of Mahomet (who tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him to be their captaine) thei forſoke Heraclius.

And amonge theſe, Pioners and Cookes, Carpenters Armourers, and ſuche other as thei muſt niedes haue to make the waye, wher the place is combreſome: to dreſſe victualles, to amende harneſſe, to make bredges o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer floudes, to trenche aboute their enne mies, to plante battries, make Ladders, and ſuche other thinges neceſſarie for the ſiege. Ther foloweth the armie alſo, ſondrye ſortes of money Maſters: ſome for lone, ſome for exchaunge, ſome to buy thinges. And ſondrie ſortes of occupiers, ſuch as be thought nedeful in ſuch caſes.</p>
               <p>But there is nothing in all that nacion more to be merueiled at, then their ſpie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe in doeyng of thinges: their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantnes in perilles, and their obedience and preciſe obſeruinge of all commaun-deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes. For the leaſt fault, of goeth the heade. Thei paſſe ouer raginge floudes, mounteignes and rockes: roughes and plaines, thicke and thinne, if thei be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded. Not hauing reſperte to theyr
<pb facs="tcp:2921:123"/>lyfe, but to their rulers. No men maie awaie with more watche, no men with more hongre. Among them is no muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng, no vproures, no ſturres. In theyr fyght thei vſe no cries, nor ſhoutes, but a certeine fiercenes of brayeng. Thei kepe ſuche preciſe ſcile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the night, through out their campe: that thei wil rather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre ſuch as they haue taken priſoners, to run their waie, then to make any ſturre. Of all the peoples at this daie, thei one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe warre, acording to the ordre of at mes. So that no manne niedeth to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nayle howe it cometh that no people this two hundred yeare and aboue, haue had like ſucceſſe vnto them. Yea, it may true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſayd, that excepte it be by ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue or murreyn, or diſcorde among them ſelues, they can not be ſubdued. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parail that the ſouldiours do vſe, is moſt comely and honeſte. In their ſadles and bridles, there is neither curioſitie, ne yet ſuperfluitie. No man emong them wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Armour, but when niede is to fight. They carry their harneſſe behynde theim, at their backes. They vſe neither banner, ſtanderde, ne flaggue: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein Iauelins that haue ſtreamynge out
<pb facs="tcp:2921:124"/>fro the toppe, diuers coloured thriedes, by the whiche euery hande knoweth his capiteine. Thei vſe a dro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and a fiphe, to aſſemble their Bandes, and to ſturre them to the batteile. When the batteile is done, all the armie is preſented to the Regeſtour (whiche is ſome one of the nobles) bothe that it maye bee knowen who is ſlain, and what nombre: and that newe may be entred in their places. In all aſſemblies and mietinges, feaſte, or other: thei praie for their ſouldiours, and menne of warre. But ſpecially aboue all other, for thoſe that haue ſuffred death for the commune quarelle of their countrie: calling them happie, fortunate, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that thei yelded not vp their liues at home, amidde the lamentacions and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailynges, of their wiues and children, but loſte them abrode, amonge the ſhou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of their enemies, &amp; the ratling of the Harneis, and Launces. The victories of their forefathers and eldres, thei put into Balade, and ſing theim with greate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſes: for that thei thinke the courages of the ſouldiours and menne of warre, be muche quickened, and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereby.</p>

And yet are there amonge the communes, men able of them ſelf alone, to ſet furthe an whole armie, furniſſhed at all poinctes. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thei are naturally giuen to ſparing and to abhorre all ſumptuouſeneſſe, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſing a lowe and ſimple ſtate: thei wel beare this volucarie pouertie, and rude, homelineſſe. For this cauſe alſo, doe thei not ſet by any kinde of Painters Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerie. As for the other imagerie of corue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grauen or molten worke, thei do ſo hate and abhorre: that thei call us Chriſtians for delighting ſo muthe in them, verie Idolatours and Image worſhippers. And do not onely ſo calle vs, but wil ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly argue, that we are ſo in dede. Thei vſe no Seales to their Lettres, of what ſorte ſo euer thei be, the kynges or other.

               <p>The garmentes aſwell of the menne, as the women, are large and longe, and open afore: that thei may the more hone ſilie and couertly hide all, when nature craueth to be eaſed.

               <p>The firſte, diepyng into the water, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Baptiſyng aftre the Greke. This, by canonicalle decree, in time paſte was not wonte to be giuen (excepte greate neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie ſoner required it) but to thoſe that had bene ſcholers a ſpace afore, to learne the thinges appertine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to chriſtendome. Yea, and that aftre thei had bene excea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly welle enſtructed in the faithe: and proufe taken of their profityng, by ſeuen examinacions, whiche ware made vpon
<pb facs="tcp:2921:138"/>ſeuen ſeueralle daies in the Lente, and ſo ware thei Baptiſſed vpon Eaſter euen, and Whiteſondaie euen. Vpon whiche daies, thei ware accuſtomed to hallowe the chriſtening watre, in euery Paroche But becauſe this ſpecially of all other, is chiefly neceſſarie vnto euerlaſting ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion: leaſſe any bodie ſhould die without it, thei decreed that aſſone as the childe was borne, godfathers ſhould be ſought for it, as it ware for witneſſes or ſureties whiche ſhould bryng the childe vnto the Churche doore, and there to ſtande with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. And then the Prieſt ſhould enquire, before the childe be dieped in the Fonte, whether it haue renounted Sathan and all his pompe and pride. If it beleue cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinely and wholie, all the Articles of the Chriſtiane faithe. And the Godfathers anſweryng, yea: for it, the Prieſte brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng thriſe vpon his face, exorciſeth it, and cathechiſeth it. Aftre that, doeth he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thinges to the childe in ordre. Firſte, he putteth into the mouth hallowed ſalt. Secondely, he mingleth earthe and his ſpattle toguether, and ſmereth the eyes, eares, &amp; noſethrilles of the childe. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, giuyng it ſuche name as it ſhall euer

Fourthly, he diepeth it thriſe in the Watre, or beſprinckleth it with watre thriſe, in maner of a croſſe, in the name of the holie Trinitie, the father the ſonne, and holie ghoſt. In the whiche name alſo, all thother Sacramentes are miniſtred. Fiuethly, weting his thumbe in the holie ointement, he maketh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with a Croſſe on the childes foreheade. Sixthly, he putteth a white garment vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon it. Seuenthly, he taketh it in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de a Candle brennyng. The Iewes before thei be Chriſtened (by the determinacion of the counſaile holden at Agathone, are cathechiſed, that is to ſaie, are ſcholers as the enſtruction of our beleue, nine mone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. And are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to faſt fourtie daies: to diſpoſſeſſe them ſelues of all that euer thei haue, and to make free their bonde men. And looke whiche of their children thei haue Circumciſed, acording to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes lawe: hym are thei bounde to baniſhe their companie.

And giueth hym a blowe on the lefte chieke, for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce of the Sacrament, that he come not for it againe. The godfathers, to the ende the enoilyng ſhould not droppe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, or by negligence bee wiped awaie, clappe on a faire filette on the foreheade. whiche thei iudge to be vnlawfully take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> awaie, before the ſeuenth daie.

And for all this, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted but one Sacramente, by the reaſon that all theſe tende to one ende, that is to ſaie,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:140"/>to conſecrate the Lordes bodie. To euery one of theſe, did the Counſaile of Tolede in Spaine, appoincte their ſeueralle li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueries, and offices in the Churche. The Doorekepers had the office of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Sexceine, to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the churche dores, to take hede to the churche, and to ſhutte the dores.

The Reader, in ſigne and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of libertie to reade the Bible, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſtories, had a greate booke giuen him.

               <p>For the fourthe Sacramente it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that euery prieſte rightly prieſted, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng to the keies of the Churche, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing an encente to conſecrate, and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynge the fourme of the woordes: hathe power, of wheaten breade to make the very bodie of Chriſte, and of Wine to make his very bloude.</p>
               <p>Chriſte our Lorde hym ſelfe, the daye before he ſuffred, kepte it ſolemply with his diſciples, and conſecrated, and ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it continually to be celebrated, and eaten in the remembraunce of him ſelfe. And about this mattier a man had nede of a great faythe. Firſte to beleue the breade to be chaunged into the body, and
<pb facs="tcp:2921:141"/>the wine into the bloude of Chriſte. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thoughe this be done euery daye that yet Chriſt for all that ſhould growe neuer a whitte the bigger for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> making, nor the leſſe for the eatinge. Thirdely that the Sacrament being deuyded into many partes, Chriſt ſhould yet remaine whole in euery cromme. Fourthly that thoughe the wicked eate it, yet ſhould not it be defiled. Fiuethly that it bringeth to as many euyll as receius it, death: and to the good euerlaſting life. Sixthly that it tourneth not into the nature of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his nouriſhemente as other meate dothe: but turneth the eater contrariwiſe into the nature of it ſelfe. And yet being eaten, that it is rapte into heauen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurte or vntouched. Seuenthly that in ſo ſmalle a ſyſe of breade and wine, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and incomprehenſible Chriſte, God and manne ſhoulde be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Then, that one, and the ſelf ſame bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye of Chriſte, at one very inſtaunce, ſhoulde be in many places, and of many menne receiued at ones, and in ſondrye parcelles. Ninethly y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoughe the bread it ſelfe be chaunged into the very fleſſhe of Chriſte, and the wine into his bloude,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:142"/>that yet to all the ſences thei remaine breade and wine, and neither fleſſhe ne bloud. Further that all theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teined in theſe verſes folowing ſhould happen vnto thoſe that worthely eate it.</p>
               <p>It putteth in mynde and kindleth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth hope, and ſtrengtheneth.</p>
               <p>Mainteineth, clenſeth, reſtoreth, giues life, and vniteth.</p>
               <p>Stabliſſheth beliefe, abates the foode of ſinne, and all vnclennes quencheth.</p>
               <p>Finally, to be very profitable for the ſaluacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwell of thoſe liuyng as deade, for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is ſpecially offred by the prieſt in the Maſſe. And therefore to haue to name <hi>Euchariſtia communio.</hi>

               <p>In the beginning of the Chriſtiane faithe (and yet amonge certeine ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques as thei ſaye) one whole lofe was conſecrated, of ſuche biggueneſſe, as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prieſt had broken it in a platter into ſmalle pieces, it mighte ſuffiſe the whole multitude that ware at the maſſe to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of. For in time paſte the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anes came euery day to communicate by a ſpeciall commaundemente, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. Aftrewarde but ones in a wicke and that on the Sonday. But whan it
<pb facs="tcp:2921:142"/>began to be ſkant well kepte vppon the Sonday neither: then was it commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that euery manne ſhould receiue it thriſe in the yere, or ones at the leaſte, at euery Eaſter. And that euery chriſtian manne, when he ſtode in any daungier of death, beynge whole of minde, ſhould receiue it as a waifaring viande, to ſtaye him by the waye: with as good prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of bodye and ſoule, as he poſſibly mighte.</p>
               <p>Matrimonie (whiche is the lawefulle coupling of the manne and the woman) broughte in by the lawe of nature, the lawe of God, the lawe of all peoples, and the lawe ciuile, is the fiueth Sacrament, The holy fathers woulde haue but one mariage at ones, &amp; that not in ſecrete but with ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſolemnitie eyther in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche, or in the churche porche, and ſo that the prieſt be called to the matier.

Yf thei be agreed (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is chiefely in this caſe requiſite) he taking them bothe by the right handes: coupleth them together in the name of the holy and vnſeperable trinitie, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

And commaundeth, and exhorteth them that thei alwaye remembring this their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling of their owue free wille &amp; conſent: as longe as thei liue, neuer forſake one a nother, but loue &amp; honour one another, be debonaire and buxome one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, giuing them ſelues to procreacion, and not to lecherous luſte. And that thei honeſtly and diligently bringe vp, ſuche children as God ſendeth them of theyr bodies. Aftre that he affiaunceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both with one ringe. And ſprinckling holy wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter vpon them, reacheth them a ſtole, and leadeth them into the churche. where (yf thei ware not bleſſed afore) he bleſſeth them knieling before the altare.

Twelue thinges ther be, whiche the holy fathers woulde haue to barre perſons from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of matrimonie, and to diſſeuer them againe, yf thei be contracted. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of perſon, that is to ſaye, miſtaking one for another. A betrowthing vpon a

               <p>The ſixteth Sacramente is penaunce or repentaunce, giuen of Chriſte as it ware for a wracke boorde, wherby men are preſerued fro drowninge. Eche chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian oughte vndoubtedly to beleue that this conſiſteth in foure poinctes.

And let him hope with this repentaunce, to be reconciled to the fauour of God againe And let him humbly, and truly with his owne mouthe, confeſſe to a wiſe prieſte, in the ſteade of God: all thoſe offences wherwith he knoweth him ſelfe to haue loſte his innocencie and clenneſſe, and to

And let him aſſuredly beleue that the ſame prieſte, hath power giuen him of Chriſte (as beinge his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, or deputie on earthe) to abſolue him of all his ſinnes. Finally for ſatiſfaction or amendes making for the faulte: lette him not with grudginge, but chierfully, and gladly doe, what ſo euer he ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And then might the Maſons ſette vpon the reſte, but not afore. This Churche did thei vſe to builde, aftre the facion of a croſſe, and not vnlike the ſhape of a manne. The Chauncelle (in the whiche is conteined the highe Altare and the Quiere) directe full into the Eaſt, repreſenteth the heade. And therfore ought to be made ſomwhat rounde, and muche ſhorter then the body of the churche. And yet vpon reſpecte that the head is the place for the eyes, it ought to be of more lighte, and to bee ſeparate with a particion, in the ſteade of a necke, from the body of the Churche.

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to good facion or chriſtiane religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with greate diligence to ſhonne it. It was the maner in the firſt churche, both amonge men and women to lette their heare growe, to ſhewe out their naked ſkinne, and very litle or nothing to diffre in apparelle. Sainct Peter put firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre, that women ſhould couer their hea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, and menne rounde their heare, and either of them to go in ſeueralle and ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drye apparelle.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide theſe he deliuered them lawes in wri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting fouretie yeres afore, of the whiche we will treate in another booke.</p>
            <p>Aftre this in the daies folowynge (for he euery daie continually preached vnto theim) he deliuered them praiers of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge and banning: the one for the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, the other for the trangreſſours of
<pb facs="tcp:2921:172"/>the lawe. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>recited he vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> verſes that he lefte in the byble, conſiſtnge eche one of .xii. meaſures the piece: and contei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forewarning of thinges to come, acording to the whiche all thinges haue happened, and happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at this preſent. So to the poincte, that it can not be ſaid that he miſſed the truthe in any thing.</p>
            <p>Theſe bookes deliuered he vnto the pri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>eſtes, and the Arcke. In the which he left the ten articles of the lawe, whiche we commenly calle the .x. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundementes written in two tables, and the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle alſo. And he gaue a leſſon to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that when thei had conquered the lande, and ware ſatled in the ſame: they ſhould not forgette the iniury of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lechites, but that thei ſhould make a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age againſt them, and take reuenge vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, for the damage and diſpleaſure thei did them, when thei ware in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerte. And that when thei ſhould enioye the contrie of Cananie, and ſhould haue deſtroyed the whole multitude of it (as it behoued, and was miete for them) thei ſhould buylde vp an altare looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, the Eaſte in ſome place, not farre from the citie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sichemites, betwene
<pb facs="tcp:2921:173"/>the two mounteines. Gariſed on the right hande, and Gibalo on the left ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. And that thei ſhould place their whole multitude vppon thoſe two mounteines beinge deuided into two equalle partes. That is to ſay on eche hille. vi. tribes, with the leuites, and prieſtes and all. And that thei firſt, that ware in the mounte Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, ſhould wyſſhe all felicitie, and bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes vnto thoſe that ware deuoute in the religion of GOD, and the keping of the lawes, &amp; threwe not at their hieles thoſe thinges that Moyſes had taughte them. And that then the other in Gibalo, aftre what time thei had luckely giuen their good conſent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſhould alſo wiſhe like proſperitie, and like bleſſednes to the like doers, anſwerably to the former.</p>
            <p>Wherunto the firſte ſhould againe giue like lucky conſente, with praiſinge them. That done he willed them in like ſorte to do with the curſinges, anſwering one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for the eſtabliſſhing of the lawes that ſhould be giuen them. And that the maner and diſcipline of this bleſſinge, and curſing, mighte neuer falle oure of vſe: he wrate them out the order of bothe with the praiers, and curſes therto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinente.
<pb facs="tcp:2921:173"/>The whiche alſo when he died he wrate vppon eche ſyde of the aulter, where he enioyned alſo the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to make the ſacrifice ſtondinge, that the Latine calleth <hi>Sacrificium Solidum,</hi> and aftre, not to offre that daye anye more ſacrifice. For why he ſaid it was not lawfulle. Thus I ſaye did Moyſes inſtitute theſe thinges, and the people of the Hebrues from daye to daye obſerued them forthe on.</p>
            <p>The nexte daie calling the whole mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude together, in ſo muche that there was neither woman nor childe, ne bonde body abſence: he charged them wondre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſore to take hede to the lawes, and not to tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſgreſſe them. But that as nion that diligently waied goddes minde and wille: thei ſhould ſpare none that offeded againſt them, neither for kindredes ſake, ne for feare. Nor yet as thincking any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cauſe to be more to be weighed, then the obſeruacion of the lawes. But rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yf any one manne of their kindered or any whole citie, would go about to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe, or abrogate the ordinau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of their commune wealthe: that thei ſhould take vengemente vpon them, bothe by officer,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:174"/>and without. And that if in ſuche caſe it fortuned them to haue the bettre of ſuche aduerſary to the lawe: that thei ſhoulde vtterly deſtroy him or them, not leauing an agguelet of a poincte for the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of ſuch hopeloſte perſones, if it ware poſſible. And in caſe thei ware not able to reuenge for lacke of power: that yet they ſhould ſo worke, that thei myghte well ſhewe that thoſe thinges ware done full euyll againſt their wille. And the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude forſothe did ſweare. He taught the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to, howe their ſacrifices mighte be made more acceptable vnto God, and how thei ſhould when they ſette forthe to the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res choſe their lucke by ſtone lottes as I haue ſhewed afore. Ioſua alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, Moyſes yet beyng preſente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. And Moyſes thus wayeng all thoſe thinges that he had done for the people, bothe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning warre, and peace in makinge them lawes, and teachinge them an ordre of a commune wealthe, by the whiche if thei directed their ſteppes, thei mighte enioye a proſperous bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: ſignified vnto them, that God had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge that thei ſhould in time to come forſake his lawes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies:
<pb facs="tcp:2921:174"/>and therfore ſuffre muche affliction and aduerſitie. In ſorte that their londe ſhould be euen filled with their ennemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. Their Cities, and townes beaten downe ſmothe to the grounde, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple burned, and they them ſeues beynge ſolde, ſhould ſerue as thralles vnto men that ſhould take no pitie of their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. And that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei ſuffred theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges thei ſhould ſore repente the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their tranſgreſſions, but then in vaine. God notwihſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that fourmed, and made ye ſhal reſtore ye againe vnto your cite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zins, bothe their Cities, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And the loſſe of theſe quoth he ſhall happen ofte ner then ones or twyſe.</p>
            <p>Then Moyſes encouraging Ioſua to marche out with the armye againſt the Cananites (as one aſſured to haue God his ayder in all his entrepriſes) and prai enge for proſperous lucke, and ſucceſſe, for all the whole multitude, ſaieth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that I muſt departe vnto our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and God hathe appoincted this the daye of my departure vnto them: I openly confeſſe before ye all yet beyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and preſent with you: the thanckes that Iowe vnto him, and now giue him,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:175"/>not onely for the regarde that he alwaye had to ye, to tourne fro ye that that was euill, and to giue vnto ye that that was good: but alſo that it pleaſed him to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coure me when I had niede of his hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping hande, in all my cares and troubles of minde, for your reformacion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendement into bettre, and ſhewed him ſelfe tendre vnto vs in all our affaires. Or raither that it pleaſed him to take in hande his ſelfe to leade in, and let out, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge me as a lieuetenaunte, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre of the benefites, wherwith he would bleſſe your people. For the whiche nowe at my leaue taking, I thoughte it conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, and fitting with my duety, firſt to prayſe and magnifie together with you, the mighty power of GOD, the whiche ſhal alſo ſhewe him ſelf carefulle for you in times to come. And he, yea eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal yelde againe to you a thanckefulnes, of his gentlenes, for your thanckefulnes of duetie: wher throughe he ſhall make you confeſſe in conſcience, that ye are for his bounteouſnes bounde to reuerence, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe, and honour him, and to haue his lawes in price. Bothe thoſe whiche he hath giuen you, and per hereafter ſhall,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:175"/>that ye maye kepe him fauourable vnto you: of all ſtores the moſte goodly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. For manne him ſelfe that is a lawe maker, becommeth a bittre ennemye, when he ſeeth his lawes broken, ſette at noughte, and throwen vndre foote.</p>
            <p>But be not ye in wille diere brethren, for the tendre loue of GOD, to proue what maner of one he is, when he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to kindle into wrathe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte of the lawes, whiche he gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, as the maker of them all. Moſes ſpeaking theſe woordes, euin to the laſte farewell of his life, and prophecieng the deſtenies of euery ſeuerall tribe, with manye woordes of good fortune and chaunce: the whole multitude braſte out into teares, ſo that the women alſo wrin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ginge their handes, and throwinge their armes abrode, ſhewed the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge ſorowe that thei felte for his death now at ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de. Yea the children cryenge, and ſobbinge aboue the reſt, as leſſe able to bridle their grief and lamentacion, declared by their pietifull wailinges that their vnderſtode, the wonderfulle vertue of him, and the excellencie of his doynges, aboue the courſe of their age. And to ſaye all, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
<pb facs="tcp:2921:176"/>of the younger, and the elder, ſtraue as it ware in balaunce, for the maiſtery, acording as thei diuerſely felte in their minde. For the one, knowing by experience what a gouernour, and chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine thei loſte: lamented their lacke for the time to come: and the other bothe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for that, and alſo and yet more, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe he was berafte them before thei had well taſted his piereleſſe wyſedome.</p>
            <p>A manne mighte geſſe the greatneſſe of the lamentacion, and mone of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: by that that happened vnto Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes him ſelfe. For where he had almoſte aſſured him ſelfe all the dates of his lyfe, that his departure out of this worlde ſhould neuer any whitte trouble him (as the thing that he muſte neceſſarily ſuffre by the wil of God, and natures lawe) yet was he by the compaſſion of the dolour of the people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to let falle the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. And goynge forthe together to the place wher he ſhould departe fro them, thei al folowed him, howling for ſorowe. And thoſe that ware fartheſt of, Moyſes commaunded with the beckening of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des to ſtaye ſtil ther aloofe. And thoſe that ware nierer, with comfortable wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
<pb facs="tcp:2921:176"/>he entreated that thei woulde not bring aftre him their teares any nigher to make his farewell more dolorous.</p>
            <p>And thei thinkinge it miete to geue him place therin, that he mighte departe his owne way as him ſiemed beſt: tourned their heades into eche others boſome &amp; ſobbed vp their ſorowes with many ſalt teares among them ſelues, &amp; with many a longe eye aftre Moyſes. Who was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied to the place only with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Counſelle, the highe prieſte Eleaſarus, and Ioſua now chiefteine.</p>
            <p>And when he was comen to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teigne named Abary (a very highe hylle ouer againſt Iericho, geuing a goodlieye vnto thoſe that are on it, into the pleaſant londe of the Cananites, farre and wyde aboute, he willed the counſeil to departe. And as yet takinge leaue of Eleaſarus and Ioſua, and talkinge with them, he vaniſſhed in a noque of the hille, beynge ſoubdenly ouercaſte with a cloude. He wrate neuertheleſſe in the holye bookes (whiche we calle the byble) that he was dead. Fearing leſſe thei ſhould take vp on them to ſaye that he departed quicke vnto God, for the incomparable vertue
<pb facs="tcp:2921:177"/>that was in him. He liued in all, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty yeres. Of the which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued .xl. in his gouernaunce, lacking but one moneth. He tooke his leaue the laſte moneth of the yere called of the Macedonies Dwiſtre, and of the Iewes Adar, in the chaunge of the mone. And he excelled in witte all the menne that euer ware, and did all that he did with goodly aduiſement &amp; diſcrecio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He was eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and faire ſpoken in vttering his mynde to the people. But ſo bridlinge his affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions that a man woulde haue thoughte ther had bene none in him. But that he knewe raither the name of them, by that he ſawe them in other: then the worcking of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by aught that he felte in him ſelf. A chiefteine with the beſt, and moſte ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert, but ſuche a Prophete as none was againe: ſo that what ſoeuer he ſpake, god him ſelfe mighte haue bene thoughte to haue ſpoken it. Aftre he was thus with drawen from this worlde, the people be, mourned him thirtye daies. with ſuche mone, as neuer had bene ſene ſo great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge the Hebrues for any miſhappe. And not onely thei that had had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of him, ware ſorye that thei lacked
<pb facs="tcp:2921:177"/>him: but thei alſo that redde his lawes ware muche kindled with the deſire of him, as folkes geſſinge by the worcke, what excellencie was in the woorckeman. Let this then ſuffice aftre this maner to haue declared the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of Moiſes fro this lyſe to euerlaſtinge immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
